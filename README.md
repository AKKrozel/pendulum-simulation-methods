# pendulum-simulation-methods

This project produces two separate real-time simulations of a pendulum. One simulation is carried out using the regular Euler integration method and the other is carried out using the symplectic Euler integration method. The simulation demonstrates the useful ability of symplectic integration methods to conserve physical quantities such as energy.

## Usage

An easy way to run this project is to add all of the files to a Visual Studio project that has been given proper access to the SFML animation library and run the project in Visual Studio. Also be sure to provide access to the appropriate text font file.

## Animation

See the video file Pendulum_Anim_Square.mp4 for a demonstratoin of the animation produced.
